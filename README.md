its a CRUD project to fetch or update required data from database, in this project i have used following spring modules and other things

1. SpringBoot
2. Spring Jpa
3. RESTAPI
4. PostgreSQL



I have created this projct in springBoot which provide auto configuration and many other features like starter project, actuator, devtools etc...so here i
have used 4 starter spring web, spring jpa, postgresql and devtool. devtool is for auto restarting the program if we make any change inside it. spring Jpa
is used to talk to database, with spring jpa we dont need to care about writng queries because its provided by jpa so all we need to focus on business logic
and RestApi is used to play with data(make any change through http request) and postgresql is the database that was used to store the data.
